We bought Sea & River House in 2007 for our future retirement home, and to have a special place to gather our kids from around the country every year – a place so spectacular they will clamor to come instead of being begged to visit their parents. And, what a success that has turned out to be. We do hope that others will find the uniqueness of the Mendocino coast works its wonders on them, too
