Dining

There is a selected list of good restaurants in the Mendocino vicinity at http://www.mendocino.com/restaurants_all.html, with further links to each establishment's own web page where you can find their menus. A more comprehensive list, although with only addresses and phone numbers, and no descriptions, can be found at http://www.mendocino.winecountry.com/thingstodo/dining/north_coastlistings.html.

Among our favorites are the Mendocino Cafe in Mendocino and the Little River Inn and the Ledford House on the highway from Sea & River House up to Albion, and Silvers in Ft. Bragg.
