          <article><p>We loved the house and are considering renting it again. By the way, the kitchen is well stocked with pots and pans. We are a cooking family and have stayed in other houses that did not have adequate amounts.<br>
          Hope to rent your place again this spring. I am actually jealous about your choice of retirement spots.<br>Thanks again</p>

          <article><p>We had a wonderful time at your house. It was a perfect setting to bring the whole <img src="images/stories/aa-resturant-albion%20inn2.jpg" src="images/stories/aa-resturant-albion inn2.jpg">family together for a time of reflection and just simply being together. We sampled sparkling wines at various wineries so as to choose the perfect wine to bring in the new year while sitting in the hot tub with a fire glowing in the fire pit. Your remodel will make the house perfect---making the downstairs accessible from the interior.<br> 
          Again, I know that we all left Mendocino with great memories, a sense of contentment and wonderment at how fast the time passed in slow-speed Mendo. Thank you.</p>

          <article><p>What a wonderful home! My husband and I went to the Sea and River house for our honeymoon and loved it. The ocean view was magnificent! It was very relaxing. The hot tub located on the back deck was such a pleasure. We were able to sit in it and enjoy not only the view but we could hear the waves and smell the ocean breeze. It was also great to take a hot cup of tea out on the deck and sit and watch the sun dance on the water. There was plenty of space inside and out! The new game room was a blast. I haven’t played foosball in years! I can’t wait to go back!

          <article><p>Thanks for letting us enjoy your awesome house. We felt at home and cozy right away, awesome views and well equipped kitchen. We did a little of everything and it was so relaxing to listen to the waves while laying on the deck lounge chairs. Again a BIG thanks!!!

          <article><p>What can I say about the Sea & River House except that is was PERFECT for my family in every way imaginable. We could not have asked for a better location and the scenery is beyond words. The house itself is warm and inviting and perfect for large families. I highly recommend the Sea & River House to anyone considering staying in the area. Thank you Peter and Molly for your hospitality and lovely home!</p>

          <article><p>Just perfect.
          The house was located in a magnificent place. The view was breathtaking. We enjoyed the sunsets as well as walking around the backyard. I would recommend this house to anyone!</p>

          <article><p>I just want to say thank you the stay at your place in Albion. My girlfriend Denise, her little one Frida, and I had such a peaceful weekend there. We BBQ'd oysters, roasted crab, made delicious breakfast, enjoyed the views from the dining room, the top deck, the hot tub, and your beautiful yard, and appreciated the heat from the wood oven. It was a much needed weekend of relaxation. I look forward to staying there in the future. Maybe take some more family members for a family getaway. Many thanks,</p>
